# playlist-organizer
WIP

Ever have the problem that you have too many "Liked songs" in spotify that are all unorganized?

This project is an attempt at a solution for just that!
Select playlists and start the music. Once you click a playlist, the song will be added to the playlist and the next song will start playing!
This way, you can quickly go through the list and slowly dwindle those numbers until you've organized all your songs.


Check out the current state of the project here:
